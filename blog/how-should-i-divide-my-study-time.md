Roughly in three parts.

* Spend 1/3 of your time reading, 1/3 listening and 1/3 doing Anki.
* Don't spend more than 1 hour a day on Anki, distribute the rest.
* Watching TV with subtitles counts towards reading.
* Here passive immersion doesn't count as "studying".

So, on a bad day when you have only `3` hours of study time,
you do each activity for `1` hour.
On a good day when you have, let's say, `12` hours a day,
you spend `1` hour on Anki,
`5.5` hours on listening and `5.5` hours on reading.

We know that [due to subvocalizing](early-output-or-reading-ahead-of-listening.html)
too much reading causes harm in long term.
Depending on your goals,
when allocating your study time,
you could **increase the time spent listening** (and watching raw)
at the expense of reading time.

Without immersion, Anki helps very little.
Trading immersion time for more Anki is definitely not a good idea.
