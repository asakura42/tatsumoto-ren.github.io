[Reading a grammar guide](learning-grammar.html) like Tae Kim is very helpful as a beginner.
You can read a grammar guide while doing the Tango decks or separately.

Most likely you will be unable to complete the Tango decks without referring to a grammar guide.
Tango decks don't teach grammar points as thoroughly as a grammar guide would do.
If you stumble upon a card that you don't understand even after reading its back,
refer to Tae Kim (or "[All About Particles](all-about-particles.html)") for explanations.
Studying grammar will make sentences in the Tango decks more comprehensible to you.
So the strategy of doing grammar+tango in a combo is the most efficient,
and probably the most popular.

As for how you'd do it,
each day you could read a chapter of Tae Kim and do 10 to 20 new Tango cards.
