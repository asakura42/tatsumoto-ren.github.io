title: I'm a beginner. Do you recommend learning the "advanced grammar" within Tae Kim's grammar guide?

[This answer](tae-kim-is-essential-grammar-enough.html) applies.

When I learned Japanese, I read Tae Kim's guide completely, but I did it in chunks.
First I learned some vocab, then I read the first section.
Then I learned more vocab and read the second one, and so on.

Decide if you're ready before starting the "advanced grammar" part.
Maybe you need to learn more words first.

Tae Kim has vocabulary lists built-in, but they're pretty much useless without example sentences.
It's better to learn vocabulary using targeted sentence cards.
This is another reason I started recommending "[All About Particles](all-about-particles.html)" more.
