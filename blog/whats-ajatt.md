AJATT stands for **All Japanese All The Time**.
It's a method of reaching fluency in Japanese in a relatively short period of time.
It encourages doing as much Japanese as you can every day,
[immersing](whats-immersion.html) yourself in the language and culture of Japan
without having to go to the country, take classes or use outdated and boring textbooks.
This means that the shortest path to fluency is to make Japanese a part of your everyday life.
The AJATT method involves learning the language
mainly through a combination of reading and listening.
This could involve watching Japanese movies and TV shows,
reading Japanese books and manga.
The method states that fun and learning are a great combination,
that Japanese should not be turned into "work" or "study",
and that enjoying the process is absolutely essential.
If the process is not fun, one should stop now or figure a way to make it fun.
AJATT was created by a person named Khatzumoto in 2006.

Some aspects of the method include
Stephen Krashen's [Input Hypothesis](what-is-comprehensible-input.html),
learning kanji through [KanjiTransition](jp1k-anki-deck.html),
using the [SRS](spaced-repetition.html) to help remember new words and phrases,
the focus on [learning sentences](sentence-mining.html) instead of vocabulary and grammar.

AJATT was also influenced by [Antimoon](https://www.antimoon.com/),
another input-based language learning method.
While Antimoon focuses on learning English,
AJATT mostly revolves around Japanese.
However, the principles can be adapted for learning any language
if Japanese-specific parts are replaced.

This site was heavily inspired by AJATT.
While doing AJATT I came up with new ideas no one else talked about
and made some tools that make learning languages easier.
Following Khatzumoto's retirement in 2023,
Tatsumoto took the reins as the successor of the original AJATT.
Here on this site
and within [our community](join-our-community.html),
we not only teach the AJATT method,
but also continue to refine and enhance it.
The goal is to bring AJATT's insights to a larger audience,
consistently updating and improving the method as we go along.
As Katsumoto once said,
AJATT does not stand still,
it is flexible and should evolve.
Therefore, we are happy to continue his work.
